        <p class="antialiased mt-2 text-black">Easter happens in April every year. It is a Christian holiday to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus.
        This is one of the days where some people go to mass in the mornings, but one treat of this day is about chocolate.
        Chocolate during this day has become a major anomaly in the world today. Although the icon of this day is the bunny, 
        so on this day, you can buy chocolate bunny's and the famous easter eggs from grocery stores. In Sydney, Australia, where I live, there is this event that goes on that is called the Sydney Royal Easter Show.
        This is a massive event that happens yearly and there are so many different attractions, although they've made it a lot about the outback of Australia, focusing on farms, animals, arts & crafts, etc.
        One of the most fun is something called "easter show bags" and are one of the major attractions at the show, because they're full of chocolate and other goodies which people love always to get their hands on.
        There's also the main event, which has shows such as, motorcross, wood chopping, fireworks finale and V8 challenge, which are stunt drivers and much much more.

            Halloween is an event that is celebrated on October 31st every year. This holiday does not have anything 
            religious tied to it, but it is the more scarier things, like vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc. 
            Halloween is a day where you dress up in a scary or any costume you like and go out trick or treating with your friends
            or if you're older, going to a party, or there are some who stay home and watch scary movies like, michael myers from halloween, 
            freddy krueger from nightmare on elm street, jason from friday the 13th, It, ghostface from Scream, etc. 
            Trick or treating is more something you partake in when you're younger, you go with your friends and knock on peoples front doors, 
            in your costume of course and yell "trick or treat", usually the person who answers puts chocolate in your bucket or what you're carrying.
            For Halloween, people also carve pumpkins as a fun activity to do, some carve faces, or things they care about from games or movies.
            What then happens, people put a candle inside the pumpkin and it glows and looking either really scary or cool at night.
            Halloween isn't all around the world, but it was originally started in America, but eventually caught on in some parts of the world and 
            is more just something people do for fun.

            Christmas is the most important time of the year for Christians. It is celebrating the birth of Jesus.
            It is celebrated mostly worldwide except for people who choose not to celebrate Christmas or people from other religions 
            who have no connections to this time so they choose not to. Christmas is all about giving and spending time with family.
            Personally, this is my favourite holiday of the year, just because in Australia during Christmas, it is summer here
            and we have barbecues and go on the beach a lot. The main icon of Christmas is Santa Claus, the infamous red dressed man who 
            comes down your chimney and leaves presents under the Christmas tree, remember to always leave him cookies and milk. Also during this time,
            people setup Christmas trees in their house,
            which always gets you in the festive spirit. One of the fun times of Christmas are christmas lights, these are special decorative lights
            that you hang on and round the front of your house for all to see. There are always a couple people every year that always go crazy with it
            and are always a spectacle to see.
            
            Christmas is also always a reminder that New Years Eve is just around the corner.

            New Years Eve is the biggest party of the year. This is the countdown to the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, 
            January 1st. This is always a time that people think about their goals and want they want to achieve in the new year.
            Some even spend that little time to reflect on how their year went and what they can do to improve or get better. 
            This is also a time where you spend it with family or just loved ones and celebrate it with them. This is also the famous 
            fireworks show that most cities around the world host, which people gather to watch. Sydney, my city have some of the best fireworks
            shows in the world. Especially overlooking Sydney the harbour and how the state government utilise the harbour bridge for this show.
