# RoutingRefactor-ZachPrice

This week we were asked to imrove on one of the exercises we did during the week. One of them was a routing html exercise, which I chose because I felt more comfortable and knew I could add more to improve on it. The task asigned was to also add our own personal touches onto the program and since Halloween is this weekend, it gave me the idea to talk about the different holidays across the year, so I just highlighted the 4 major holidays in my opinion and these are Easter, Halloween, Christmas and New Years. 

As for the how to improve on the exercise, I wasn't sure on how to improve it fundamentally with the routing as I couldn't find anything online on how I could improve it that way, instead I went down the design route. During this exercise I also took the time to learn Tailwind, an extensive library onto CSS. Tailwind is the best experience I have ever had with a css library, it is so so simple and has so many different features.

## How to use

The program is so simple to use, all you have to do is scroll, also if you want to test the routing, you click on the buttons or links in the navbar and each should take you down to each section. 

## Conclusions
In the exercise during the week, we were doing some of it in the JavaScript, although I didn't see the reason of that since you can easily do it in HTML using the #links and div id's.

I thorougly enjoyed this exercise, just because I was able to learn Tailwind and I really enjoy the design side of creating a website.
